# Ballz
Hello, welcome to my game. It's fairly straightforward.

## How to play
- You click somewhere on the screen and a stream of balls is shot out.
- These balls break the blocks that are generated every round.
- You level up for every round that you don't die.
- If you hit a white block, you get one more ball to shoot.
- The game ends if any block reaches the bottom. After every round all the blocks move down a layer.

It gets pretty intense when you have like 120 balls shooting all over the place, but the graphics are very basic so you don't really need great specs to run it.

And yes, I am aware that the name is terrible, but I'm committed to it now.

## Requirements
- Python3
- Pygame

## How to run it
- ```cd``` into the repository from the Terminal (or the equivalent on Windows)
- Type in ```python3 ballz.py```

Please feel free to mess with it as much as you like, I'm very open to suggestions.
